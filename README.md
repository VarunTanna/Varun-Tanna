## Project Highlights

- **Food and Drinks:** A webiste that allows you to search for your favortie food and drinks recipes and gives you the ingredients and instructions to make it, built using HMTL, CSS and JavaScript.
- **Trip Planner:** Many people dream about seeing the world despite leading very busy lives. When trying to plan trips, it can be difficult to remember the dates and destinations of each trip you’ve planned. With our site, you can add trips to your dashboard that will remind you of the days you plan to leave and when you plan to return. Within your trips, you can also add destinations so you never lose track of when you plan to arrive and depart from each trip’s destination. You can also use our site to plan potential trips, as they can always be deleted and altered, built using HMTL, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL and deployed with Heroku.
- **Ticket Logger:** The ticket logger site allow users to sign-up or login. Once a user has logged in, they can see the groups and projects which they are a part of, and easily create new ones. When something goes wrong with the project, users can submit a ticket reporting their issue so other group members are able to collaborate easier. Built using, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, React.js, Webpack, GraphQL, Apollo and Express.
